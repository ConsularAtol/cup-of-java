# Cup Of Java

Cup Of Java is a mod that adds coffee to the game. These coffees are helpful for multiple reasons such as potion brewing and repelling phantoms.

## Basic Brewing

The main method of getting coffee is through brewing in a coffee maker. Coffee makers can be crafted with iron, a furnace, a cauldron, and a redstone dust like so:

Once you've made a coffee maker, you can now start brewing.

This is the coffee maker gui, brewing a coffee in it is simple. The bottom slot is where you'll place a mug of water. You can obtain a mug of water by crafting a mug and using it like a bottle on water. Here's the crafting recipe for the mug:

The next likely step is to get a coffee bean, coffee beans are obtained from coffee plants found in forest biomes. Their functionality is identical to sweet berry bushes, and are also farmable. Once you have a coffee bean, you can place it in the top slot of the coffee maker.

Already, with just these two items, we unlock our first coffee. With just water and a coffee bean, we can brew a black coffee. The black coffee is the most basic, and provides nothing other than food unless brewed with a potion (we will discuss that later).

## Advanced Brewing

Now that we know the basics of how the coffee maker works, we can more easily utilize the left and right slots of it. 

# Milk Slot

The slot on the left is the milk slot, brewing a coffee with milk provides a different output entirely. Any coffee that's brewed with milk will clear all negative effects as well as granting any postive effects it may have.

By simply adding milk to our black coffee recipe, we get the cafe au lait. The cafe au lait behaves identically to black coffee, but with the added benefit of being brewed with milk.

# Potion Slot

The slot on the right is the potion slot. By putting any potion in here, modded or vanilla, that potions effects gets added to the coffee. Simple as that, our coffee is slowly becoming a multi-purpose consumable.

# Ground Coffee Beans

Ground Coffee Beans allows for even more types of coffee to be brewed. Ground coffee beans can be put in place of regular coffee beans, and any coffee brewed with them instead grant the caffinated effect. The caffinated effect simple freezes your insomnia ticks, effectively preventing phantoms from spawning.

So, in the end, we have an item that restores hunger, clears negative effects, grants more effects, and repells phantoms. Who would've thought a crippling caffine addiction can do that? 

## Barista Villager

The barista villager is just a simple villager that sells their coffee related items to you. You can get one by simply bringing an enemployed non-nitwit villager to a coffee maker.
